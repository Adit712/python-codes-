# Variables
# Variables are containers for storing data values.

# Creating Variables
# Python has no command for declaring a variable.

# A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

# Example
x = 5
y = "Amit"
print(x)
print(y)
# Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.

# Example
x = 4       # x is of type int
x = "Siya" # x is now of type str
print(x)
# Casting
# If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

# Example
x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0
# Get the Type
# You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.

# Example
x = 5
y = "Amit"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
# You will learn more about data types and casting later in this tutorial.
# Single or Double Quotes?
# String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:

# Example
x = "Motu"
# is the same as
x = 'Motu'
# Case-Sensitive
# Variable names are case-sensitive.

# Example
# This will create two variables:

a = 4
A = "Amit"
#A will not overwrite a
